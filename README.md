### Hi there, I'm Sabrina!🌌

I'm a highschool student at A. Y. Jackson Secondary School. Currently doing a super-cool internship at Ciena programming a controller for a test chamber using an Arduino! ☄️

I'm always interested in side projects, so if you need help on anything or even just need a teammate feel free to reach out to me! 😺
